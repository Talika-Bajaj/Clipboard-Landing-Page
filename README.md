# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page

![Design preview for the Clipboard landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 25th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

I honed my layout skills by completing an HTML & CSS landing page challenge from Frontend Mentor. This project emphasized attention to detail and included designing hover states. It was an excellent practice that boosted my confidence in creating visually appealing websites. Successfully replicating the design improved my proficiency and precision in front-end development.

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
